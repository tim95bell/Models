I achieved all functionality except for picking.

When you are not in piciking mode, clicking on the screen will allow 
the mouse to move the camera around.

The models are in rows, each row is higher up and futher back into the screen.
This is so that all models can be seen from both the the front view,
and from the birds eye view.


init.js is
This is the starting point. It creates an instance of App, 
    hooks up the event listeners, and calls the run method on the App object.

App.js
This is the main class that runs everything, holds the state, and has the gameloop.

Model.js
This represents a model.
Main functionality is update and draw.
